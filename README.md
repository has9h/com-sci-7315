# Computer Vision 2025 (Postgraduate Coursework) 
# Assignment 4: Deep learning challenge

> This assignment is worth 30% of your course grade.

For this final assignment, we prepared four challenges that will be run as a "competition".
A percentage of the mark is determined based on your model's performance and efficiency, please refer to the [assessment](DATASETS.md#assessment) session.

You will choose one of the four challenges to work on. 
You are free to play with all datasets and notebooks, and it may be helpful to expand your knowledge by doing so, 
but you will be assessed only on the challenge you submit.


> If you don't have sufficient local computation resource to train deep networks and rely on Google Colab, 
> please note that Google Colab has daily limits on GPU/ CPU usage, 
> which might restrict your progress. Please start the assignment as practically as possible, 
> keep the computation constraints in mind to ensure the timely submission of your assignment.
> 
> One tip is that you can time your training of one model instance and easily figure out how many times you can retrain a model in a day or a week, that is
> if you have a script that can manage retraining the model sequentially and non-stopping to test different training/model configurations.

## Challenge Information

The datasets and assessment information can be found [here](DATASETS.md).

## Participation

You can elect to work in a team with a maximum of 2 students. That is:
1. You and another student work on the same challenge of your mutually agreed choice, both students will receive the same mark as the outcome of this assignment.
2. You may choose to work a challenge by yourself.
3. No other form of collaboration are allowed across teams. Once discovered, it maybe viewed as a breach of academic integrity and may be reported.


Record your teammate and the choice of your dataset through this [Google Sheet Link (external link)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WiA26ybOkjGujvwdhcVq5WnrcVZni_zFbKbXsskyoFM/edit?usp=sharing).

Please register your team before `23:59:59PM 01/08/2025`. Please read the followings carefully:
> 1. After the registration date, we will assume unregistered students would like to work alone.
> 
> 2. After the registration date, formed team members may choose to work independently (even continue working on the same challenge separately), if in this case, please notify course coordinator.
> 
> 3. After the registration date, no new teams may be formed.
> 
> 4. Students may switch challenges, however, this does not constitute a valid ground for waiving late penalty or other forms of consideration in assignment marking.


## Submission

Submission format:
1. Please submit a notebook consisting of your final model trained and tested. Please convert the notebook to a PDF and submit to the [MyUni submission portal](https://myuni.adelaide.edu.au/courses/105236/assignments/446619). 
2. The .ipynb notebook and other supporting files should be put in a separate zip file and uploaded to the same submission portal. 
**There is no separate Gradescope portal for this assignment.**
3. Please submit your final report as a **separate PDF file** following the instructions. 
This two-page report should indicate your model's performance and efficiency, with a discussion on how you attained gains over the baseline. 

Several important notes:
> 1. Please name the notebook converted report "A4_{challenge_name}_report.pdf", e.g., A4_Animal_Classification_report.pdf.
> 2. Please name the two-page report "A4_final_report.pdf". On the front page, clearly show the team members' names and A-numbers.
> 3. The two members of a single team should submit the same material, but both team members should submit to their own MyUni portal.

These reports will be the primary documents used for grading the assignment. 
It is the students' responsibility to ensure that the submitted code and reports correspond to each other. 
File submission via other means other than via MyUni submission portal is not admissible for grading.

The due date of the assignment can be founded in MyUni. Standard penalty applies for late submission.
